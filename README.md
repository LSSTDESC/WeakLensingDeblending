Weak lensing fast simulations and analysis for the [LSST](http://www.lsst.org/lsst/) [Dark Energy Science Collaboration](http://www.lsst-desc.org/).

This code was primarily developed to study the effects of overlapping sources on shear estimation,
photometric redshift algorithms, and deblending algorithms.

User and reference documentation is hosted at http://weaklensingdeblending.readthedocs.io/ and also available as a [single pdf document](https://readthedocs.org/projects/weaklensingdeblending/downloads/pdf/latest/).
